# SinguLab is now FacsimiLab

We have renamed the SinguLab project to *FacsimiLab*!

Our new name is a portmonteau of [**facsimile**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facsimile) and **laboratory**. Not only is it "more unique", it is also more reflective of the project's objective: to create a reproducible research environment with identical packages and platforms.  Using environment files and [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compatible build instructions, FacsimiLab will be the path forward for replacing "it works on my computer" with "I've looked at your data and reproduced your results".

We hope you follow our project's ongoing development at [github.com/FascimiLab](https://github.com/FacsimiLab) and [pranavmishra90/FacsimiLab](https://github.com/pranavmishra90/FacsimiLab-platform).

This GitHub repository at [pranavmishra90/SinguLab](https://github.com/pranavmishra90/SinguLab) is now archived.
